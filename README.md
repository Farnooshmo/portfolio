# Portfolio App

Welcome to my portfolio app! This project showcases my various projects and serves as a platform to highlight my skills and experiences. Whether you're a potential employer or a curious developer, feel free to explore my work and learn more about my journey in the world of web development.

## Technologies Used

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): A React framework for building fast and scalable web applications.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework that helps in building modern designs with ease.
## Why Next.js?
I chose Next.js for this project because I wanted to stay updated with the latest in the Next.js ecosystem. Next.js provides a powerful and flexible environment for building React applications with features like server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and more. It enables me to create a fast and optimized portfolio that reflects my commitment to using cutting-edge technologies.
## Why Tailwind CSS?
Tailwind CSS was selected as the styling framework for this project. Having seen several tutorials, I wanted to build a better relationship with Tailwind CSS and avoid disliking it after just one project. I'm happy to share that through this project, I've developed a stronger understanding and appreciation for Tailwind CSS. It's a utility-first framework that allows for rapid development without sacrificing flexibility. Tailwind CSS complements Next.js well, providing a straightforward way to style components and maintain a consistent design system.



## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
